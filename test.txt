    git branch -b feature - changes the branch you are working in. This is done when you need to change and test code before implementing into the main branch or source code.
    git checkout master - Always switch to main/master then merge using title of branch to be merged into master.
    git merge feature - Merges the sub branch into the main/master branch. 

Notes for Deleting Branches, Files, & Folder
--Create Branch: git checkout -b newBranchName, git add ., git commit -m "added newBranchName"
--Deletion from Folder: Requires changes to be staged then committed
--Deletion from File: git rm fileName.fileExtension. If the file can't be deleted then go into the directory using cd folderName.
--git reset --hard HEAD~#of commits to return to
--git branch -D branchName deletes the branch. Change the branch you are on first using git branch -m branchName.
--git checkout -- . resets the branch to the last commit.
