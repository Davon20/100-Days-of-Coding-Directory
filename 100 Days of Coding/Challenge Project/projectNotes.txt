7min of 1hr - I'm measuring how many hours it takes to complete this project in fragments of 50/10 Pomorodo.

2hr Objective: Use follow along to answer questionable developments.

    ---19min of 2hr - The structure of my code is flawed. 
    ---43min of 2hr - In terms of what was demostrated as being required, 
    my code is still elementary. There are many components that could've been
    added that I didn't consider. I need more practice on building page 
    structure.
