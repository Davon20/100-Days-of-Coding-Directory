This is the initial commit!

git init - Sends the remote file to Git Server. 
git status - Displays what files have been changed. What needs to be tracked. What needs to be committed.
git add fileName - Only use the fileName, otherwise a submodule will be created causes code conflicts.

git config --global --edit - Displays user information who changed code.(This command creates a .gitconfig.swp for some reason???)
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email

This is the secondary commit! 

git add fileName1 fileName2 when adding multiple files. When adding files, be in the directory of those files.

git branch - Displays all of the branches being used. 
git branch -m newName - changes the name of branch.
git checkout -b - creates new branch and also changes between available branches.
git checkout -b newBranch - creates a new branch by that naming convention. 

Understanding Branches Follow Along Notes:
1. Create new branch. git checkout -b newBranch
2. Create new folder. Create new text file within folder. These will only exist in newBranch, seperate from master.
3. git add fileName to add changes. git commit -m "adding new file and folder".
4. To MERGE - 
    a. git checkout master
    b. git merge newBranch
    c. This merges the commits from newBranch into master. 
5. Resolve Merge Conflicts 
    a. Accept Current or Incoming Changes
    b. Save File
    c. git add . file w/changes
    d. git commit -m "accepted changes"

Deleting Files, Directories, & Branches:
Always use git rm 'fileName' as just removing files from folder will require the changes to be staged while the command removes the file from the staging area already. 
    How to stage deleted files? git add .(This . wouldn't be applicable to how I'm trying to learn to delete files, so I'll create a dummy file to delete.)
